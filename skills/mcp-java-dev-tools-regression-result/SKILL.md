# MCP JVM Regression Result

Use this workflow to generate run summaries from persisted artifacts under `.mcpjvm/regression/<plan>/runs/<run_id>/`.

## Execution Mode

This skill runs in two phases:

1. `Read`
2. `Render`

Do not render from transient logs when artifacts are available.

## Portable Source of Truth

Always align with:

1. `references/spec-rules.md`
2. `references/authoring-checklist.md`
3. `references/templates/index.md`
4. `references/templates/http_result_table/endpoint_table_result.md`

These references are bundled with the skill so it remains installable and usable across repositories.
If user request conflicts with these rules, fail closed and return deterministic blocked guidance.

## Source of Truth

Read only from persisted run artifacts:

1. `.mcpjvm/regression/<plan>/runs/<run_id>/execution.result.json`
2. `.mcpjvm/regression/<plan>/runs/<run_id>/evidence.json`
3. optional `.mcpjvm/regression/<plan>/runs/<run_id>/context.resolved.json` for non-secret context display

## Template Routing

1. default template: `endpoint_table_result`
2. when user asks to "tablize", "show as table", or equivalent, route to `endpoint_table_result`
3. future template IDs must be documented in `references/templates/index.md`

## Extensible Presentation Modes

Support user-driven display formats while preserving deterministic field mapping:

1. `table` (default)
2. `compact` (one-line per endpoint)
3. `narrative` (short summary + top-level metrics)
4. `debug` (includes deterministic diagnostics and reason codes)

## Probe Coverage Enum

For rendered endpoint results, use only these deterministic values:

1. `verified_line_hit`: strict `Class#method:line` probe verification confirmed
2. `http_only_unverified_line`: HTTP-level assertion passed without strict line verification
3. `unknown`: coverage could not be deterministically mapped from artifacts
4. `n/a`: placeholder only for blocked/no-step rows

## Governance and Redaction

1. Never render secret values from artifacts.
2. Respect artifact redaction (`[REDACTED]`) as-is.
3. Do not reconstruct secret material from surrounding fields.
4. If requested output would expose secrets, fail closed and explain blocked field.

## Fail-Closed Conditions

Return deterministic blocked guidance when:

1. required artifact files are missing
2. artifact JSON is invalid
3. required result fields are absent and cannot be deterministically mapped
4. requested template is not registered

Blocked response must include:

1. exact missing/invalid artifact or template id
2. deterministic reason code
3. single next action
