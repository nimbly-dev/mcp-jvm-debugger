# Regression Result Spec Rules

This file defines normative rules used by the result skill.

## Artifact Inputs

Required:

1. `.mcpjvm/regression/<plan>/runs/<run_id>/execution.result.json`
2. `.mcpjvm/regression/<plan>/runs/<run_id>/evidence.json`

Optional:

1. `.mcpjvm/regression/<plan>/runs/<run_id>/context.resolved.json`

## Template Contract

1. Every template id MUST be documented in `references/templates/index.md`.
2. Default template id MUST be `endpoint_table_result`.
3. Unknown template ids MUST fail closed.

## Endpoint Table Result

Required columns:

1. `Endpoint`
2. `Status`
3. `HTTP Code`
4. `Duration (ms)`
5. `Probe Coverage`

Allowed `Probe Coverage` enum values:

1. `verified_line_hit` (strict line verification confirmed)
2. `http_only_unverified_line` (HTTP assertions passed without strict line verification)
3. `unknown` (coverage cannot be deterministically mapped)
4. `n/a` (placeholder only for blocked/no-step rows)

`Memory (bytes)`:

1. MUST be shown only when memory metric is explicitly contract-defined.
2. MUST be omitted entirely otherwise.

## Deterministic Rendering

1. Rows sorted by `step.order` ascending.
2. Tie-break by endpoint text.
3. Missing optional fields render stable placeholders (`n/a`).
4. No-step runs render exactly one placeholder row.

## Redaction and Safety

1. Secret values MUST NOT be re-exposed.
2. `[REDACTED]` values from artifacts MUST remain redacted.
3. Renderer MUST fail closed when required fields cannot be mapped deterministically.
